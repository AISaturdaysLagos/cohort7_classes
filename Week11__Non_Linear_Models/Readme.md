## Assignment
For assignment/projects, these are the global expectations:
- Go through the notebooks and try to understand how the machine learning theory/maths you have learnt over the week translates into code.
- Try to implement the code by typing the same codes on your jupyter notebook and running them. (with understanding, so that it doesnt become 'dubbing':nerd_face:) . If you hit errors, (which is human), please dont hesitate to ask questions here.
- You can optionally attempt to answer the questions I asked in class to win the prize. (or chill and learn from the winner) [UPDATE: Jerry Adedugbe won]

- Prize Question: solve the bug that is causing high cost function values (hint: something is wrong with one of the formula implementation)

**2. Multivariant Linear Regression -**

- Prize Question: There is a section in the notebook asking a question about a plot. Answer that question

**3. Logistic Regression, Higher Degree Polynomials and Regularisation -**
- Notebook - [Link](https://github.com/AISaturdaysLagos/Cohort3/blob/25018b99975b8b7000790b832efd362379c0b870/Beginner/Week8/Notebook/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb "Logistic Regression")
- Prize Question: None, but play around with the regularisation parameters and polynomial degree to see its effect on the model.

**4. Digit Classification with Logistic Regression -** 
- Notebook - [Link](https://github.com/AISaturdaysLagos/Cohort3/blob/25018b99975b8b7000790b832efd36237[…]870/Beginner/Week10/Notebook/Neural%20Networks%20Learning.ipynb "Neural Networks")
- Prize Question: None, lets just see how gangster you can be.


Submission for the prize questions will be on slack. 

I will only be awarding the first person to post his/her answers here on slack.

If one person answers the two questions, he or she gets one prize. (so that small will remain for other:wink:)

The 'competition' is valid until Wednesday 17th November 2021. After that date, you answer even if it is the first will attract no prize. Lets say its contribution to knowledge :joy:

The prize is one AI Saturdays Lagos branded T-shirt:man_dancing:.
