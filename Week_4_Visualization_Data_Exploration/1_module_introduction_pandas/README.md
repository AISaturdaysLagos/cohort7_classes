Module 1: Introduction to Exploratory Analysis
=====

Welcome to first module! In this module, we start exploring our [Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/) dataset.

Goals
----
- Load our data and do some quick exploration
- Understand the data using descriptive statistics and graphs

Topic overview
----

The goal of exploratory analysis is to summarize the main characteristics of a data set, with the belief that it may lead to new hypotheses that inform algorithm choice and experimentation. Exploratory analysis happens before formal modeling commences, and is extremely important for helping inform or sharpen your hypothesis.

Installation
----

If you have not installed the datasets yet for this repository, machine_learning_for_good, you can execute the following in this folder, `module_1_introduction_pandas`

```
git clone --single-branch --depth=1 https://github.com/DeltaAnalytics/machine_learning_for_good_data ../data
```
> If you are in the main folder, then just remove the `../` at the end, and leave it as `data`.
